Simple Redis queue in R.

## Installation

```r
drat:::add("mrc-ide")
install.packages("rrq")
```

## Testing

To test, we need a redis server that can be automatically connected to using the `redux` defaults.  This is satisfied if you have an unauthenticated redis server running on localhost, otherwise you should update the environment variable `REDIS_URL` to point at a redis server.  Do not use a production server, as the package will create and delete a lot of keys.

A suitable redis server can be started using docker with

```
./scripts/redis start
```

(and stopped with `./scripts/redis stop`)
